        This demo illustrates a common challenge in data analysis: estimating the true causal effect of an intervention (like a promotion) when other factors (confounders) influence both the intervention and the outcome. We'll use <strong>Regression Adjustment</strong> to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE).

                <p>We simulated data for <strong>{{ results.n_customers|intcomma }}</strong> customers. Some received a promotion (`received_promo=1`), others didn't (`received_promo=0`). Our goal is to estimate the true causal effect of this promotion on subsequent customer `spending`.</p>
                <p><strong>The Challenge (Confounding):</strong> In our simulated data, customers with higher prior `engagement` scores were intentionally made more likely to receive the promotion. Engagement *also* directly influences spending (more engaged customers tend to spend more regardless of the promotion). This makes `engagement` a <strong>confounder</strong> because it affects both the treatment assignment (getting the promo) and the outcome (spending).</p>

                <p>To account for the confounding effect of `engagement`, we used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression. We modeled the outcome (`spending`) based on both the treatment variable (`received_promo`) and the confounding variable (`engagement`).</p>
                {# Consider using |safe only if you absolutely trust the source and need HTML rendering #}
                <p>The regression model fitted was: <code>{{ results.regression_formula }}</code></p>
                <p>
                    By including the confounder (`engagement`) in the model, the coefficient for `received_promo` provides an estimate of the promotion's effect *while holding engagement constant*. This helps isolate the promotion's impact from the pre-existing differences between the groups.
                </p>
                <p>We then used this fitted model to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) via these steps (simplified):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Predict the potential spending for <em>all</em> customers under the scenario where they <em>had</em> received the promo (setting `received_promo=1` for everyone in the model).</li>
                    <li>Predict the potential spending for <em>all</em> customers under the scenario where they <em>had not</em> received the promo (setting `received_promo=0` for everyone).</li>
                    <li>Calculate the difference between these two predicted potential outcomes for each customer.</li>
                    <li>The ATE is the average of these individual differences across all customers.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-xs italic text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
                    Note: This method assumes a linear relationship between the confounder and the outcome, and that we've measured and included all significant confounders (often strong assumptions in real-world data).
