        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm used extensively in Python and the libraries powering data science and machine learning. Understanding OOP helps in using tools like Scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch effectively and in building more organized, reusable code.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objects (Instances):</strong> Concrete occurrences created from a class. Each object has its own state (values of its attributes) but shares the behavior (methods) defined by the class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Variables bound to an object, representing its properties or state (e.g., a `LinearRegression` object might have a `coef_` attribute).</li>
                    <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Functions bound to an object, defining its behavior or actions it can perform (e.g., a `model` object has `.fit()` and `.predict()` methods).</li>
                    <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (the object), often hiding internal implementation details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Creating a new class (subclass or derived class) that inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class), allowing code reuse and specialization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways (e.g., different Scikit-learn models all having a `.fit()` method, but implementing it differently).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Procedural Programming:</strong> Focuses on procedures or functions that operate on data. Code is organized into functions, often leading to global state or data being passed around extensively. Simple scripts often start this way.</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Programming (FP):</strong> Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability (data doesn't change after creation) and avoiding side effects. Functions are first-class citizens. Found in languages like Scala, Haskell, and increasingly used within Python (e.g., `map`, `filter`, list comprehensions, libraries like `functools`). Helpful for parallel processing (like in Spark).</li>
                    <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> Organizes code around objects that bundle data and behavior. Well-suited for modeling real-world entities or complex systems with interacting components.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In Practice:</strong> Python supports multiple paradigms. Data science workflows often blend them: using functions for specific processing steps (procedural/functional style) while heavily interacting with objects provided by OOP-based libraries (like Pandas DataFrames or Scikit-learn models).</p>

                <p>This consistent object-based interface (`fit`, `predict`, `transform`) across different models and transformers is a direct benefit of OOP design (Polymorphism).</p>
                <p>Similarly, Keras/PyTorch models and layers are classes you instantiate and combine. Pandas DataFrames are objects with methods for manipulation. OOP provides the structure that makes these powerful libraries organized and extensible.</p>
