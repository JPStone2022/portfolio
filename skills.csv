NumPy,numpy,"The fundamental package for numerical computing in Python. It provides powerful N-dimensional array objects, linear algebra functions, Fourier transforms, random number capabilities, and more. It's the foundation for many other data science libraries.",Data Analysis,0
Pandas,pandas,"Built on top of NumPy, Pandas offers high-performance, easy-to-use data structures (like DataFrames) and data analysis tools. It's essential for data cleaning, manipulation, merging, reshaping, and analysis",Data Analysis,1
Python,python,A popular programming language used in data science,Programming,2
Keras,keras,used as part of machine learning,Data Analysis,3
Matplotlib,matplotlib,"The most established Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It provides a wide range of plot types (line plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, etc.) and fine-grained control over plot elements.",Data Analysis,4
Seaborn,seaborn,"Built on Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It simplifies creating complex visualizations like heatmaps, violin plots, pair plots, and integrates well with Pandas DataFrames",Data Science,5
Scikit-learn,scikit-learn,"The go-to library for traditional machine learning algorithms. It offers efficient tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction, classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and evaluation.",Data Analysis,6
